                        <h5>What is debugging?</h5>
                        <p>
                            Debugging is a multistep process used to solve a
                            problem within an application. This process involves
                            identifying the problem, isolating the problem,
                            correcting the problem, or finding an innovative
                            solution around it. Finally, test the correction or
                            solution to ensure the intended outcome is executed.
